                                      LETS GAMBLE OUR LIVES AWAY--Nat'l Lampoon Style

Project based around creating a classic casino game , with gambling, winning, and losing and being escorted off the premises for acting up.

Create a "casino floor" where the user will risk it all for a few greenbacks..

create a running stats bar that lets you know just how deep in the hole you really are.

Create 2 players to play against each other for serious moolah. Alternately, have a human player play against the dealer(CPU).

create a rich game environment using HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.

This will be a casino game with at least one casino-style gambling game based around the casino Clark Griswold and his brother
go to in Vegas Vacation. 

Start out with a limited amount of money...game is over when you are cleaned out!!

For example---//Pick a number//War//Rock Paper Scissors//Pick a hand//
